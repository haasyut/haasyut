### Featured Projects
A few highlights that reflect my coding style, problem-solving approach, and system design interests:

#### [Search Ranking Pipeline](https://github.com/haasyut/search-ranking-pipeline)
Built a full ranking pipeline using Spark, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch to optimize search results for relevance.  
Created relevance labels from user behavior logs and trained SVM and neural models with offline A/B testing.

#### [Sarcasm Detector](https://github.com/haasyut/sarcasm-detector)
Deployed a fine-tuned BERT-based text classifier as a web app with Streamlit and Hugging Face Spaces.  
Achieved 92% accuracy on 30K+ labeled samples for sarcasm detection.

#### [COVID-19 Model Comparison](https://github.com/haasyut/covid-model-comparison)
Compared ARIMA and SEIR models to forecast COVID-19 case trends.  
Explored trade-offs between time series forecasting and mechanistic epidemiological modeling.

### Skills

#### Languages:

- **Python** ‚Äì Primary programming language across all major projects and internships. Used extensively for building scalable systems (e.g., ANN vector search **benchmark** at TikTok), model training (**PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**), and **data processing** (Pandas, NumPy).  
- **C++** ‚Äì Used in performance-critical components, such as optimizing parts of the TikTok benchmarking system and implementing object-oriented modules for efficient memory and execution handling.  
- **Java** ‚Äì Familiar with object-oriented design and syntax. Used for coursework and small-scale backend prototypes; comfortable reading and modifying Java-based systems.  
- **SQL** ‚Äì Applied in both relational (**MySQL**, PostgreSQL) and **NoSQL** contexts for data extraction, transformation, and query benchmarking.  
- **R** ‚Äì Used in academic research and time series modeling (e.g., SARIMA for COVID-19 trend analysis).  
- **Bash & Perl** ‚Äì Used for scripting and automation in infrastructure tasks, especially during Docker orchestration and **CI** logging in GitLab pipelines.

#### Frameworks & Libraries:

I‚Äôve worked extensively with **PyTorch** and **Scikit-learn** for **machine learning model** development, using them to build a neural ranking model and SVM baseline in a search relevance pipeline at ZTE. During my TikTok internship, I integrated **FAISS** into a benchmarking system for vector search, tuning indexing methods (HNSW, IVF) to optimize performance across PostgreSQL and Redis baselines. I also fine-tuned **BERT** using **Hugging Face Transformers** and deployed it via **Streamlit** and **Hugging Face Spaces** in a real-time sarcasm detection app. During a startup internship, I used **LangChain** to prototype document-to-structured-data pipelines, combining open-source **LLMs** with modular chain design. **TensorFlow** was used in coursework for prototyping standard **deep learning models**.

#### Dev Tools & Infrastructure:  

At TikTok, I containerized benchmarking workloads using **Docker** and automated testing through **GitLab CI**, integrating YAML pipelines for repeatable deployments. I set up **Jenkins pipelines** to streamline Docker image builds and orchestrate benchmark execution on **AWS EC2** instances, improving deployment reliability and reducing setup overhead. I also used **Flask** to build lightweight internal APIs for comparing performance metrics across PostgreSQL, Redis, and custom vector systems. For other backend components, I‚Äôve worked with **Git** for version control, managed CI logs using **Perl scripts**, and used **Django** for small-scale backend service prototyping.

#### Database & Search:

At TikTok, I worked with both **relational** (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and **NoSQL** (Redis) databases to benchmark vector search performance. I used FAISS to build high-dimensional ANN indices and integrated the system with MySQL-based infrastructure, comparing performance across PostgreSQL and Redis baselines in terms of QPS, latency, and recall. During model evaluation, I stored and queried structured benchmark logs to support automated result analysis. At ZTE, I applied **Apache Spark** for large-scale data processing and used **search log data** to generate training sets for ranking models. My pipeline included feature construction, label generation based on user interaction signals, and **offline A/B testing** for search result optimization. I‚Äôve also worked with **MongoDB** for lightweight document storage and query retrieval in LLM-related prototypes.

#### Other:

Spark, Time Series Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, ANN Vector Search, Benchmarking, CI/CD

When I‚Äôm not debugging or benchmarking, you can find me reading sci-fi, watching *The Big Bang Theory*, or listening to Prince.
